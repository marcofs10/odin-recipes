    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>1 kg of fish fillet</li>
        <li>14 big lemons</li>
        <li>2 medium red onions</li>
        <li>2 slime peppers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>50 grams of cilantro</li>
        <li>100 grams of yuyo (optional)</li>
        <li>4 large leaves of fresh lettuce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the fish into cubes of about 1.5 cm approximately 
            and place it in a bowl or similar container. Then add 
            the garlic, two teaspoons of salt and pepper to 
            
            taste, stir so that the seasonings penetrate the fish 
            well.</li>
        <li>Next, peel and cut the onions into julienne strips. Then pass them through cold water with salt and reserve.</li>
        <li>Now chop the limo pepper into thin strips and add it to the bowl. If you want your ceviche to be very spicy, before chopping it, squeeze it gently with your fingers and cut it with everything and pepas (seeds).</li>
        <li>Then wash and chop the coriander finely and add to the bowl, stir well so that it integrates well with the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the lemons in a container until you get a little more than half a cup and add it to the preparation. Stir the entire mixture well, when the fish takes on a whitish appearance, it means that it is already at its marinating point.</li>
        <li>To conclude, add the previously reserved onions, mix them well with the fish and adjust the salt level. Consume immediately for a greater enjoyment of this dish.</li>
